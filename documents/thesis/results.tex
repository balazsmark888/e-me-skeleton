\chapter{Results and evaluation}\label{ch:elemzes}
\begin{summary}
	In this chapter I describe decisions I made, difficulties I faced during development and the quality of my code.
\end{summary}


\section{Metrics}
In this section I will evaluate some of the algorithms used in the application, test coverage, code analysis. 4 pages

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\input{encryption.tikz}
	\caption{Encryption/Decryption duration over document size}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
	\item chart about the duration of the encryption (time versus file size)
	\item service-level test coverage
	\item code metrics
	\begin{itemize}
		\item maintainability
		\item cyclomatic complexity
		\item average depth of inheritance
		\item average class coupling
	\end{itemize}
	\item system requirements
	\begin{itemize}
		\item server
		\item mobile
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Decisions}
Here I describe decisions I made about what technologies to use, what I considered using and how they can be replaced with other ones. 3-4 pages

\begin{itemize}
	\item backend
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Java
		\item Python
	\end{itemize}
	\item frontend
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Kotlin
		\item Java
		\item React Native
	\end{itemize}
	\item why I chose C\# and .NET instead of native languages
	\item Data storage
	\begin{itemize}
		\item MySQL
		\item MongoDB
		\item Oracle
		\item Firebase
	\end{itemize}
	\item Auth technologies
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Cookie-based auth
		\item Multi-factor auth
		\item Biometric auth
	\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\section{Obstacles and difficulties}
In this section I contemplate about different parts of the applications that were problematic to develop. 3 pages

\begin{itemize}
	\item HTTPS on Android
	\begin{itemize}
		\item difficulties connecting to the server on HTTPS
		\item certificate issues
	\end{itemize}
	\item Windows CNG not being implemented in Mono
	\begin{itemize}
		\item switching to the open-source ECDH implementation
	\end{itemize}
	\item accessing resources within the Android secure storage (icons, config files etc.)
\end{itemize}

\section{Possibilities}
Here I describe possible features, future upgrades for the app. 1-2 pages

\begin{itemize}
	\item Adding biometric authentication
	\begin{itemize}
		\item fingerprint
		\item face recognition
	\end{itemize}
	\item ML based form categorization
	\begin{itemize}
		\item categorize unknown fields based on user inputs
	\end{itemize}
	\item Requirement-tree for documents
	\item digital signatures
	\item notifications (expired/soon-to-be expired documents)
	\item Administration application
	\begin{itemize}
		\item validating data
		\item granting permission for document release
		\item preparing templates
	\end{itemize}
	\item IOS release
\end{itemize}

\section{Retrospective}
In this section I review the development process and describe what would I do differently and why. 1-2 pages
